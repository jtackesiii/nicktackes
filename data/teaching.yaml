      "This course is an investigation of religious developments
      in India within a historical context. Students will familiarize
      themselves with the religions of the subcontinent—including Hinduism,
      Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, and Judaism—through
      secondary source readings and English translations of primary source
      materials. Rather than survey religious traditions as closed systems
      divorced from time or place, students will grapple with the central
      theories and historiographical challenges pertaining to religion in
      India, especially those that impact our ability to understand
      everyday religious experience, past and present."

    desc:
      "Students in this course examine the complex relationship between space,
      society, and religious identity in South Asia, past and present.
      The course will draw upon Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic materials
      to analyze the ways in which the idea of ‘sacred space’ has been
      used in political, social, and legal contexts for decidedly secular objectives."

  - course: "Gurus, Godmen, Godwomen"
    venue: Hamilton College
    img: "/img/GurusGodmenGodwomen.png"
    desc:
      "What leads people to place unwavering faith in others? What are the ramifications of relationships between everyday people and those they revere as semi-divine? This course explores issues of faith and charisma within weekly case studies of Indian gurus, popularly referred to as “godmen” or “godwomen.” We will investigate how such figures gain, use, and sometimes lose popularity and power. The primary context of this course is Hindu India, but we will also consider notable examples of gurus who have gained appeal in the US. The final six weeks of the course will involve an intensive collaborative archival project in conjunction with Hamilton College’s Special Collections and LITS."

  - course: Hinduism and Healing
    venue: Hamilton College
    img: "/img/HinduismHealing.png"
    desc:
      "How do Hindus understand and pursue health? To what extent do historical,
      regional, class-based, gender-based, age-based, and other differences impact
      the stakes, objects, and methods of healing? How can healing help us understand
      what it means to be or become Hindu? We will investigate these idiosyncrasies
      and overlaps by considering various instruments of healing. We will examine
      five such instruments in this course, without any presumption that these are
      the only five: healing with medicine, with persona, with place, with bodies,
      and with posture. Due to the timeliness of the topic, the sixth unit departs
      from the “instrument” model and instead considers Hindu responses to COVID-19."

  - course: Mother Nature--Climate Crisis--Hinduism
    venue: Hamilton College
    img: "/img/MotherNature.png"
    desc:
      "Is religion good or bad for the natural world? How do we conceptualize
      ecosystems, environments, and the relationship of humans to other forms of
      life? How do the attitudes and practices that emerge from such ideas protect
      or imperil the physical environments in which we live? Using Hindu contexts
      as case studies, we will consider the relationship between religion and the
      environment. No prior coursework on Hinduism is required. The course generally
      progresses in two-week pairs. During the first week of each pair, we will
      consider how Hindus ascribe divinity to various facets of the natural world.
      During the second week of each pair, we will evaluate religious responses
      to ecological disasters that threaten the inviolability of the environment
      as sacred space."
