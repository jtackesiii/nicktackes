    venue: NYU

    desc:
      "This course is an investigation of religious developments
      in India within a historical context. Students will familiarize
      themselves with the religions of the subcontinent—including Hinduism,
      Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, and Judaism—through
      secondary source readings and English translations of primary source
      materials. Rather than survey religious traditions as closed systems
      divorced from time or place, students will grapple with the central
      theories and historiographical challenges pertaining to religion in
      India, especially those that impact our ability to understand
      everyday religious experience, past and present."

      "Students in this course examine the complex relationship between space,
      society, and religious identity in South Asia, past and present.
      The course will draw upon Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic materials
      to analyze the ways in which the idea of ‘sacred space’ has been
      used in political, social, and legal contexts for decidedly secular objectives."
